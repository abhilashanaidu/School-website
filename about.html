        Lala Raghubir Singh believed that nations are built in schools. In times, when education was considered to be the privilege of the rich, Lala Raghubir Singh imagined a school that would provide exceptional educational opportunities to children across caste and creed. 
        The school would combine India’s traditions with the needs of a modern future.<br/>

In 1920, the dream was born. It took shape as the Modern School. Lala Raghubir Singh knew that in the years to come, citizens would need to step up to administer the country through transition, change and growth.
In the historic period of our freedom struggle, Modern School was founded with the promise to build leaders.
Since India's Independence in 1947, Modern School has created a legacy of leaders that have shaped India and continues to do in modern times.
Our values are embedded in our crest.<br/>

The Modern School crest signifies the Circle of Eternity crossed by the three elements in human development – the body, mind and spirit.
While the sun shines between the circle and the triangle, the banyan tree represents strength of character; the swan, a symbol of refinement and the lotus, signifies culture and the arts. For a sound system of education, a close interconnection of the physical, mental and moral is fundamental.
